# Difference Between Objects and Classes in Java

## Definitions
### **Classes:**
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects in Java. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.

### **Objects:**
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that has both state (attributes) and behavior (methods) defined by its class.

### **Conceptual Differences:**
- **Class:** A static blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects.
- **Object:** A dynamic instance created from a class that holds actual data and can perform actions.

## Example Code
The project includes a `Person` class and a `Main` class to demonstrate the differences between classes and objects.

## Running the Code
To run the program, compile and execute the `Main` class in your IDE.
